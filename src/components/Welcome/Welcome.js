            I am a determined and motivated individual with
            a keen interest in Web Development. I have completed my Tertiary studies in
            2018 with a Bachelor of Science at University of Canberra and recently, a Certificate
            IV in Business Administration at Canberra Institute of Technology. I have recently completed
            an online course about Web Development in Udemy with Zero to Mastery Academy and
            I am looking forward to my journey in becoming a Web Developer in the near future.
